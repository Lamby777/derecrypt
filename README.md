# What is this for?

Derecrypt is a tool to clean up and process strings. The tool is aimed for ethical hackers and people taking part in cryptography challenges / CTFs, but it can be used for daily use as well.

Made for me and my teammates' ease of use in CyberStart and RUSecure.

Formerly called StringSuite, but apparently [that's already a C++ string library's name](https://github.com/Loara/StringSuite), so I changed it to be more unique.
